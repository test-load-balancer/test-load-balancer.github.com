  <h3>Starting up with TLB:</h3>
  <div class="scope section">
    <a href="./starting_up.html">Starting Up</a> is usually a good place to start.
    <p class="clob_end"/>
    We maintain a project(called {% include sample_projects_link %} ) that has example setup(s), written for different frameworks and build-tools in corresponding languages to demonstrate how <i>TLB</i> can be hooked up with your test suite.
    <p class="clob_end"/>
    The <i>sample projects</i> repository has one directory per build-tool/testing-tool scenario. For instance, there is a directory named <i>ant_junit</i> which demonstrates [Ant(build tool) + JUnit(testing framework) + TLB] setup and <i>test-unit_example</i> which demonstrates [Rake(build tool) + Test::Unit(testing framework) + TLB] setup.
    <p class="clob_end"/>
    {% include documentation_config_vars_link %} explains <i>TLB</i> configuration. Once you have a rough picture of what variables <i>TLB</i> expects and uses, and the possible values, you can start tweaking corresponding values the <i>sample project</i>  of your interest, and observe how it affects behaviour.
    <p class="clob_end"/>
    <div class="notice warning">
      Use git tag {% include 0_1_1 %} on {% include sample_projects_link %} repository.

  <h3>Configuration Variables:</h3>
  <div class="scope section">
    <i>TLB</i> exposes all of its configuration parameters (knobs to tweek its behaviour) through environment variables. 
    <p class="clob_end"/>
    This means, all it takes to tweak a config parameter is setting an environment variable before you start the build(which uses tlb) or tlb-server. This helps decouple <i>TLB</i> from its environment. Since environment variables set for parent process are visible to child processes as well, its possible to say, configure half of these variables in your shell-initialization and set the other half just before executing tests.
    <p class="clob_end"/>
    Check {% include config_link %} page for detailed documentation on all environment variables <i>TLB</i> uses.

  <h3>Components of TLB:</h3>
  <div class="scope section">
    <i>TLB</i> has two major functional components.
    <p class="clob_end"/>
    {% include tlb_components_description %}
    <p class="clob_end"/>
    We recomend users to get a good understanding of roles these two components play. As <i>TLB</i> evolves, the list of alternative algorithms is likely to grow for these functional components. Since <i>TLB</i> configuration allows for a lot of mix-and-match style setup, understanding the role of these components at a broader level enables users to tweak it in ways that work best for them.
    <p class="clob_end"/>
    In addition to the functional components mentioned above, <i>TLB</i> has an infrastructural components as well called <b>talk to service</b>. This component is responsible for enabling <i>TLB</i> to talk to remote server that acts as a data repository. <i>TLB</i> uses this abstraction to download test-results, test-times etc from this repository and to publish the run-feedback back to the repository(which is used by future builds).
    <p class="clob_end"/>
    <i>TLB</i> is going to continue introducing such abstractions as it evolves, because this style lends itself to enormous flexibility and configurability, and allows us to provide useful options at every level that user can choose from. In addition to this, it allows users to write their own implementation for these abstractions, hence allowing easy plugability and extensibility.
