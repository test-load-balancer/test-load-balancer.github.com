<li><strong>Test Runner</strong>: This is the runner that actually runs the tests. TLB does take the responsibility of running tests. That is still handled by the underlying framework i.e. the Test Runner. Example: JUnit, RSpec, Test::Unit, NUnit etc.</li>
<li><strong>Partitions</strong>: These are the parallel machines/VMs/processes/threads that run the <strong>same</strong> build task. With TLB hooked in, each of these partitions execute mutually exclusive sets of tests. This is also responsible for kicking-off the build so that the test framework and TLB are started up. Typically the machines that execute test-task(s)(in-turn partitions) in a CI environment, are agents from build grid machines or build farm of a CI/build server.</li>
<li><strong>Server - Balancer communication</strong>: Balancer posts test-related-data about current test run to the server and obtains historical data when it is trying to balance and re-order.</li>
