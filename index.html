  <h3>What is Test Load Balancer (TLB)?</h3>
  <div class="scope section">
    Test Load Balancer(TLB) is a tool that can automatically partition tests into multiple subsets each one of which can be executed in parallel. The execution can happen on different physical/virtual machines or on the same machine as different processes or threads. This mechanism will significantly improve the speed of a test stage in a build pipeline and speeds up the feedback loop. TLB can be used for any of unit, integration or functional tests.
    <p class="clob_end"/>
    In addition to balancing, TLB also allows you to do other interesting things like re-order tests within a subset before they get executed. For instance, run tests that failed in the previous run first.

  <h3>What is the problem TLB trying to solve?</h3>
  <div class="scope section">
    <h4>Context</h4>
    <p>A good amount of time spent in building code is on running tests. Over a period of time, as tests increase in number, the build process starts taking a long time. This is particularly true for automated functional tests. With slow builds when things break, it is a frustrating process to wait for hours to make sure the build is fixed. How can builds be speed up?</p>
    <p>Given that hardware costs are dropping significantly and that tests should inherently be independent of each other (otherwise its a big smell that needs to be fixed) most people opt for the option of parallelizing the test execution.</p>
    <p>Most build servers provide the capability of executing across multiple machines like Hudson, Go, TeamCity, Bamboo etc. Lets say a build grid with many machines/VMs or a powerful machine that can run multiple test processes in parallel is ready.</p>
    <h4>The Problem</h4>
    <p><strong>How do you make sure when your test suite executes in parallel on your build grid, each test runs only once and all the tests get run?</strong> You also need to make sure that all the machines finish at about the same time. This is the problem TLB solves for you.</p>

  <h3>How does TLB work?</h3>
  <div class="scope section">
    <p/>
    {% include components_of_tlb %}
    Balancer hooks-up with your build-framework and testing-framework to do the actual work, whereas Server is primarily a data-repository that balancer talks to. Data from previous run(s) is used by the balancer to partition/re-order the current run, and data from the current run is posted back so that it can be used for future runs.

  <h3>What Language/Platform can TLB be used in?</h3>
  <div class="scope section">
    <p>TLB is written in Java. That means TLB can be used on pretty much all platforms where Java can run.</p>
    <p>However, TLB is written from ground up to support both JVM and non-JVM based languages and runtimes. The Balancer is capable of running as a standalone process, in alien-environment (as we call it) setup. The framework and language that tests are written in does not matter.</p>
    <p>{% include tlb_rb_link %} for instance, runs on MRI (CRuby) and uses standalone balancer. However, since TLB-core is written in java, you will need to have java installed on the box running tests (so balancer process can be launched).</p>
    <p>Look at the end of this page to see the list of all frameworks that TLB supports right now.</p>
    <p class="clob_end"/>
    Infact, it feels like running balancer standalone is actually a better option in most cases, because it has the inherent advantage of process level isolation.

  <h3>Quick start: Get balancing in minutes</h3>
  <div class="scope section">
    You can visit {% include tlb_getting_started %} to start using TLB (in minutes) on your project. It gives basic definition and step by step instructions on how to setup TLB on your project.

  <h3>Deep dive: Understanding and Configuring TLB</h3>
  <div class="scope section">
    While {% include tlb_getting_started %} is a good place to start off, you may want to look at how to configure TLB to your needs and understand the basic concepts involved. With this understanding, you can leverage a lot of things that TLB has to offer.
    <p class="clob_end"/>
    {% include documentation_starting_up_link %} is a good place for the concepts. Please check the {% include documentation_config_vars_link %} section for detailed documentation on TLB configuration.
