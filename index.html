    <h3>What is Test Load Balancer (TLB)?</h3>
    Test Load Balancer is a tool that can automatically partition tests among multiple sets, each one of which can run on different physical machine. This can significantly improve the speed of a test stage in a pipeline, and significantly shorten the feedback loops for large or slow running test suites such as functional or UI tests.
    <p class="clob_end"/>
    In addition to balancing, it also allows you to do other interesting things like re-order your tests-subset, before it executes. For instance, run tests that failed in the last run, first.

    <h3>How does TLB work?</h3>
    <p/>
      TLB has two primary components.
      <ul>
        <li><a href="">A Server</a>: that can stores and allows querying of test data(test times/test results etc)</li>
        <li><a href="">A Balancer</a>: that knows how to partition and re-order suite of tests, given a server url</li>
      </ul>      
      Balancer hooks-up with your build-framework and testing-framework to do the actual work, whereas Server is primarily a data-repository that balancer talks to. 
      <image src="images/tlb-cycle.png" class="center-468"/>
      Data from previous run(s) is used by balancer to partition/re-order the current run, and data from the current run is posted back so it can be used for future runs.

    <h3>Can TLB be used for test suite written in a non-java/non-jvm language(Ruby, C#, Python etc..)?</h3>
    <p/>
      <strong>Yes</strong>. While TLB is written in Java, it was written from ground up to support both jvm and non-jvm based languages/runtimes. Balancer is capable of running as a standalone process, in alien-environment(as we call it) setup framework/language that tests are written in does not matter. {% include tlb_rb_link %} 
    for instance, runs on MRI(CRuby) and uses standalone balancer. However, since TLB-core is written in java, you will need to have java installed on the box running tests(so balancer process can be launched).
    <p class="clob_end"/>
    Infact, it feels like running balancer standalone is actually a better option in most cases, because it has the inherent advantage of process level isolation.

    <h3>How do I configure and use TLB on my project?</h3>
    <p/>
    Please check the {% include documentation_link %} 
    section for detailed documentation on TLB.
    <p class="clob_end"/>
    {% include starting_up_link %} 
    is usually a good place to start.

    We maintain a project(called {% include sample_projects_link %}
) that has example setup(s), written for different frameworks and build-tools in corresponding languages to demonstrate how TLB can be hooked up with your test suite.
    <p class="clob_end"/>
    TLB exposes all its configuration parameters (knobs to tweek its behaviour) through environment variables. Please refer the {% include config_link %} 
    section for details.
