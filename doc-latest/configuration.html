      TLB is a completely non-gui/non-cli/no-config-file kinda tool. Its very configurable(lots of knobs to turn) and makes it very easy for you to write your own implementations and plug-em-in if you want to. 
      <p class="clob_end"/>
      TLB uses <i>Environment Variables</i> for every single configurable parameter it supports/exposes. Usually when configuring something thats an algorithm, we use fully-qualified-java-class-name of the class(which makes it easy for you to write alternate implementations, dump em in the classpath and have TLB load em with just an environment variable value flip).

                In order to split tests into subsets based on data(say based on test time) or order tests based on say the result last time(for instance running tests that failed in the last run first), the test times and test results need to be stored somewhere. While balancing TLB gets this historical data off the storage and decides how to balance and re-order tests based on it and post feedback to the storage(so it can be used to balance test suite next time). This variable controls what server should the balancing instance(the process running tests) talk to in order to get/publish data.

                TLB loads the class that TALK_TO_SERVICE points to, and uses an instance of that to talk to service. The contract for the class used here is enforced by a java interface called TalkToService

                This variable is relevant only in the scenario where <i>DefaultingTestSplitterCriteria</i> is used as <i>TLB_CRITERIA</i>. 
                <i>DefaultingTestSplitterCriteria</i> tries multiple criterion in the order they appear in this value. 
                The role of <i>DefaultingTestSplitterCriteria</i> is to only delegate to other criterion. It tries to delegate the balancing work to other criteria classes in the order user has specified.
                If balancer fails to balance using the first criteria, it moves on to the second one and tries balancing again, and then third and so on. 
                <p class="clob_end"/>
                This is why we recomend a using a complex and more powerful criteria like <i>TimeBasedTestSplitterCriteria</i> first, but since it needs historical data, 
                it fails when historical data is unavailable(which will be the case during the very first build using TLB). For situations like these, we recomend chaining it with a simpler criterion like <i>CountBasedTestSplitterCriteria</i>, 
                which doesn't need any historical data, but doesn't balancer as good as <i>TimeBasedTestSplitterCriteria</i> either.

                TLB_APP needs to be set before launching the TLB process using <code>$ java -jar tlb-all-gXXX.jar</code> or equivallent. This tells the TLB process what type of application user wants started.
                If it is set to BalancerInitilizer, TLB process starts the balancer application. If it is set to TlbServerInitializer it starts the server application(which we call <i>TLB Server</i>. If not set it defaults to 
                TlbServerInitializer(thats how <code> $ java -jar ... </code> always starts TLB Server and not Balancer.

                Needs to be set only if you are implementing TLB-support in for a new language. TLB subprojects like TLB_rb set it internally, so this one doesn't need to set it explicitly.
                <p class="clob_end"/>
                It doesn't make sense to set it on the server side, because you are obviously trying to run the server there(which is the default anyway).

                Is required only in the case of non-java frameworks, like Ruby etc.(defaults to TlbServerInitializer, can be set to BalancerInitializer for balancing server).

                Balancer is actually a very light-weight HTTP server. The actual library that hooks-up with testing-framework or build-tool starts this server before running tests, and shuts it down after all tests finish. 
                <p class="clob_end"/>
                While thats perfect, the http server needs a port to bind to, and this needs to be configured by you as a user, because TLB doesn't want to assume a port and fail a couple tests in turn, that depend on that port being free.

                TLB supports a notion of version for test times(and smoothened test times). This is important because while balancing every partition must see the exact same data(else the partition may not turn out to be mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive, which means the same test suite may run twice(on two different partitions) or some test suites may not run at all. 
                <p class="clob_end"/>
                This variable is relevant on the TLB Server. This governs how long the version is going to stay in the server(after which server will purge it, and if it gets another request for that version after the purge, will create a new version from the latest data snapshot). 
                <p class="clob_end"/>
                This must be significantly larger than the time test-load-balanced build is expected to take, because the snapshot will be taken when the very first partition queries the server with an unknown version, and must live untill last of balanced partitions is done fetching data.

                Setting <i>SMOOTHING_FACTOR</i> does not mean all balancing instances running against the server will be smoothened. Weather to use smoothing or not is decided by another environment variable on the partitioning process side named <i>USE_SMOOTHING</i>.

Similarly, assuming smoke tests are partitioned across 3 instances, they must all use ‘smoke-tests’(or something similar) as the value of this variable.

                When a suite is balanced against TlbServer, the dataset(test time, result etc) is maintained as one mutating set on the server. In a real world balancing scenario, test runner instances(partitions) do not all start at the same time. 
                <p class="clob_end"/>
                This means out of 3 partitions for instance(lets call the partitions A, B and C), A may have started running tests and may have already reported result and time for a few tests by the time B and C start. However, B and C must balance based on the exact same version of data that A started out with(and not the updated data, which has feedback from A). To solve this problem, TLB has a concept of version-ing. When A starts running, it posts the TlbServer a version string(against which the server stores a snapshot of data thats relevant for the corresponding TLB_JOB_NAME. When B or C queries data using the same version, the frozen snapshot is returned(which ensures that all partitions see the same snapshot of data, in-spite of server receiving feedback continuously and the actual namespace dataset evolving. Usually this can be set such that it changes between suite-runs. For instance, when A, B and C trying to balance build number 10, build number can be used as JOB_VERSION. 
                <p class="clob_end"/>
                Using a unique version ensures the frozen(hence stale) data is not used for balancing/ordering the new run of the same test suite(when the next build is triggered all three partitions start with the corresponding build number, which may be 11, hence the frozen snapshot of data is not used. Recursive variable substitution can be used to make sensible and satisfactorily unique version strings.

                <p class="clob_end"/>
                TLB allows environment variables interpolation, which means you can use a string that is composed of references to other environment variables(that change between builds, but remain the same for jobs in a build).
                <p class="clob_end"/>
                For instance, when balancing a Go stage, using TLB Server, <code> $JOB_VERSION = ${GO_PIPELINE_COUNTER}-${GO_STAGE_COUNTER} </code> can be a sensible value. TLB will resolve the refered values before using the variable.
