  <h4>Concepts in TLB</h4>
  <div class="scope section">
    {% include concepts_link %} gives details on all the concepts on which TLB is built. This is useful if you want to understand what all you can do with TLB. We strongly suggest that anyone who wants to use TLB in production at least get a hang of this.
    <p class="clob_end"/>
    We maintain a project called {% include sample_projects_link %} that has example setups  written for different frameworks and build-tools in their corresponding languages to demonstrate how <i>TLB</i> can be hooked up with your test suite.
    <p class="clob_end"/>
    The <i>sample projects</i> repository has one directory per build-tool/testing-tool scenario. For instance, there is a directory named <i>ant_junit</i> which demonstrates [Ant(build tool) + JUnit(testing framework) + TLB] setup and <i>test-unit_example</i> which demonstrates [Rake(build tool) + Test::Unit(testing framework) + TLB] setup.
    <p class="clob_end"/>
    {% include documentation_config_vars_link %} explains TLB configuration. Once you have a rough picture of what variables <i>TLB</i> expects and uses, and the possible values, you can start tweaking corresponding values on the <i>sample project</i>  of your interest, and observe how it affects behaviour.

    <h4>Configuring TLB</h4>
  </label>
  <div class="scope section">
    TLB exposes all of its configuration parameters (knobs to tweek its behaviour) through environment variables. 
    <p class="clob_end"/>
    This means, all it takes to tweak a configuration is setting an environment variable before you start the build (which uses tlb) or TLB Server. This helps decouple TLB from its environment. Since environment variables set for parent process are visible to child processes as well, its possible to say, configure half of these variables in your shell-initialization and set the other half just before executing tests.
    <p class="clob_end"/>
    Check the {% include config_link %} page for detailed documentation on all environment variables TLB uses.
